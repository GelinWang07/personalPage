Artificial Intelligence (AI)
===============
In Trumpf GmbH, I was worked as a R&D intern in a pre-development department. Here I was engaged in working on the machine learning application and development on optical sensor. From data collection, cleaning and labeling, simulation and real signal processing, dabase connection and working, to AI-model training with Keras and Tensorflow. During the internship, the image classification task and concept based on optical sensor by using CNN are realized from none. 

In my master thesis then, the work is focused on the optimization of this statistical model by concerning distributed system and data.

Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM)
===============
Perception and Localization
---------------
In my bachelor thesis, a modified approach is presented to estimate the three Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) orientation of a RGB-D camera in indoor environments. An estimator is derived from 3D point clouds and utilizes the RANSAC algorithm und surface normal vectors to detect planes in the Manhattan World. This visual compass works in the indoor man-made scenes and could reach the capability of being real-time in CPU. Moreover, the possibility of combining the information from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is also covered, which serves as a pre-development for sensor fusion.

Path Planning
---------------
In this robot project, a map-based navigation approach by using grid exploration is developed for an indoor robot in both simulation and real world scene. Here the robot explores the environment by lidar and constructs the map by GMapping. The grids are then generated in the map so that the robot stops at each point of a grid and performs a task. Then the robot could autonomously reach as much grids as possibile in the detected environment based on the presented grid traversal algorithm. Moreover, the optimizations possibilities of avoiding collision and checking the path validation are also covered.

Controlling
---------------
In this "Mechatronic Systems and Products" workshop, a mobile robot is designed, constructed and programmed to fulfill the competation task from zero to everything. Here the mechatronic systems are developed to carry out the delivery and removal of construction material as well as the construction of two high-rise buildings under camera-localization-system. Not only the construction concept are free-chosen and cutten by lasermachine by ourselves, but also the whole controlling moduls writing for motor, sensor, actor. Me as a software developer, the moduls are programmed by Matlab&Simulink on micro-controller.

System Development
===============
Industrial Systems
---------------
In Siemens AG, as a software test engineer, I was engaged in developing test concepts and programs for TIA portal and SIMATIC relevant products based on C#. Here I had the chance to use and understand more about PLC and industrial control systems.

In Trumpf GmbH, as a R&D intern, I was focusing on the development of OPC-UA relevant technicals, which are maily used for communication between KUKA robot and sensors.

Distributed Systems
---------------
Except algorithm and math problems, system development is also an interesting art of technology. Among them, distributed system could enhance performance of applications and may provide more possibilities and availabilities. Furthermore, combining AI and distributed system is also going to be a research hotspot recently. Currently, I am studying the relevant courses and technicals in Cousera such as Docker, Spark and HDFS.

Management
===============
Techfest TUM
---------------
The TECHFEST MUNICH is an international technology festival and hackathon. I have participated in this hackathon in 2018 and luckily won the 2nd place at the Siemens-sponsered challenge "let it flow" with an AI-and Data-based Alarm system for production line.

Leadership & Teamwork
---------------
After successful working of workshop "Mechatronische Systeme und Produkte" as a teamplayer, I have also participated in the workshop "Leadership of interdisciplinary teams" at the next year. Here I have learned how to lead employees in product development in a practical environment.
