
from research to production
===============

My work and research are mainly focused on CV and SLAM, AI and robotics, sensor and system development. In the field of industrial usages, the management and development of production are also the challenges I am looking forward to. Currently, my work is focusing on distributed machine learning. After my master study at KIT in early 2022, I am seeking for the opportunities of a Ph.D position in the above mentioned area. If you are interested in my work, don't be hesitated to contact me for the further cooperation.
