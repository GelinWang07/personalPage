Distributed Systems
---------------
Except algorithm and math problems, system development is also an interesting art of technology. Among them, distributed system could enhance performance of applications and may provide more possibilities and availabilities. Furthermore, combining AI and distributed system is also going to be a research hotspot recently. Currently, I am studying the relevant courses and technicals in Cousera such as Docker, Spark and HDFS.
