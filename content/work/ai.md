Artificial Intelligence (AI)
===============
In Trumpf GmbH, I was worked as a R&D intern in a pre-development department. Here I was engaged in working on the machine learning application and developing on optical sensor. From data collection, cleaning and labeling, simulation and real signal processing, dabase connection and working, to AI-model training with Keras and Tensorflow. During the internship, the image classification task and concept based on optical sensor by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) are realized from none. 

In my master thesis then, the work is focused on the optimization of this statistical model by concerning distributed system and data.
