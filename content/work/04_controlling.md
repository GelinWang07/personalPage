
Controlling
---------------
In this "Mechatronic Systems and Products" workshop, a mobile robot is designed, constructed and programmed to fulfill the competation task from zero to everything. Here the mechatronic systems are developed to carry out the delivery and removal of construction material as well as the construction of two high-rise buildings under camera-localization-system. Not only the construction concept are free-chosen and cutten by lasermachine by ourselves, but also the whole controlling moduls writing for motor, sensor, actor. Me as a software developer, the moduls are programmed by Matlab&Simulink on micro-controller.
