Industrial Systems
---------------
In Siemens AG, as a software test engineer, I was engaged in developing test concepts and programs for TIA portal and SIMATIC relevant products based on C#. Here I had the chance to use and understand more about PLC and industrial control systems.

In Trumpf GmbH, as a R&D intern, I was focusing on the development of OPC-UA relevant technicals, which are maily used for communication between KUKA robot and sensors.
