Running
===============
"Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. " --Haruki Murakami

In my childhood time on the track team, sprinting and long jump were main majors for me. When I started my uni-life in Germany, the long-distance running was just a time-killing way at the very first. However, the pleasure of running is slowly increased after regular training. It really helps me to thinking deeper and faster, working with more patience and focus. Since then, I have participated in the local running race every year in Karlsruhe mostly, for example 
"KIT Running", "Spartan race" and half-marathon. In my to-do list, full-marathon and "Spartan race: Beast" are the next challenges to overcome.
