Running
===============
"Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. " --Haruki Murakami

In my childhood time on the track team, sprinting and long jump were mainly focused for me. When I started my uni-life in Germany, the long-distance running was just a time-killing way at the very first. However, the pleasure of running is slowly increased after regular training. It really helps me to thinking deeper and faster, working with more patience and focus. Since then, I have participated in the local running race every year in Karlsruhe mostly, for example 
"KIT Running", "Spartan race" and half-marathon. In my to-do list, full-marathon and "Spartan race: Beast" are the next challenges to overcome.

Soccer
===============
Since 2019 I was elected as captain of Karlsruhe Chinese Soccer Club. Every year our team not only join the competition games between chinese teams from other cities in Europe, but also play the friend match with German soccer clubs. We have also won the 2nd Prize in the  "South Germany Cup" between Chinese soccer clubs before. Our soccer family is also looking for more friends to join us.

Volunteer
===============
Volunteering can offer unique and exciting opportunities. It is also easy to find the like-minded, motivated and positive people. 

In 2018 I was fulfilled the role "TECHFEST CAMPUS AMBASSADOR" in the interdisciplinary Hackathon TECHFEST MUNICH 2018.

In corona-year 2020 I have participated in Volunteer Service for giving epidemic prevention "Health Kit" which was organized by Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Frankfurt and the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars in Karlsruhe.
