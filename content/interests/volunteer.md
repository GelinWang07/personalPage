
Volunteer
===============
Volunteering can offer unique and exciting opportunities. It is also easy to find the like-minded, motivated and positive people. 

In 2018 I was fulfilled the role "TECHFEST CAMPUS AMBASSADOR" in the interdisciplinary Hackathon TECHFEST MUNICH 2018.

In corona-year 2020 I have participated in Volunteer Service for giving epidemic prevention "Health Kit" which was organized by Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Frankfurt and the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars in Karlsruhe.
